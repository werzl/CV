Full stack developer for 7 years, including 2 years leading teams.

I’m an experienced software developer, with a love of problem solving. I consider myself ‘T shaped’ - possessing a broad skillset and strong ability to work across many disciplines, but also an ability to go deep on the specialisations I am interested in - Kubernetes app development & frontend development are two I’ve spent a lot of time on.

As a Dev Manager / Scrum Master, I bring a history of overseeing the delivery of Cloud Native software. My teams delivered features from conception/discovery through to release with regular public release cycles.

As an individual contributor, I gained experience diving into technical problems in which I produced high quality research and decision records, and crafted solutions that were maintainable and easy to work with.

As Adam, I enjoy reading books, podcasts, PC gaming, cars, F1, and triathlon (Ironman 70.3 Weymouth in 2025). I also love to cook.
