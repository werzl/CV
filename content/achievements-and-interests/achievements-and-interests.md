I'll keep it short and sweet:
  
- Tough Mudder
- Microsoft Ignite London
- Full UK driving license
- Blogging on <a href="https://medium.com/@ahewitt_89859">Medium</a>
- Helping out in the kitchen with family at the [Kings Arms Frating](https://www.thekingsarmsfrating.co.uk/) (yes I made the website)
- My homemade <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/b/WvTWGX">Gaming PC</a> build is still kicking (2014, wow!)
