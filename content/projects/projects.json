I needed a way to quickly make a change and see it propogate instantly on the frontend. I decided to go with GitHub, in order to make it open. An added bonus is a free proof-read; if a friend or potential employer spots a mistake or wants to suggest an improvement, they can create a pull request on this repository! :)"
