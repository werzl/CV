Hi! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm A Bachelor of Computer Science, and Full-Stack Cloud Developer.  
  
I love problem solving, and when I'm not swearing at my PC because my lambda function won't deploy, or furiously debugging code at 2am, I wake up every day loving what I do. As the founder of the React guild at Glasswall, I have a real passion for JavaScript, Node, ES6 and React. I'd love to contribute to some open source projects where I can learn and collaborate on these!  
  
In my current role, I'm working with both Azure and AWS to build cloud-agnostic, serverless solutions. Having fun innovating and building on existing products by moving them to the cloud. The tech stack for this work is Typescript, Python, C#, Docker/Kubernetes and React.  
  
Lately, I've been working in development 'squads' while following an Agile Framework similar to the Spotify Model.  
I enjoy working as part of these small, high-impact teams. Partly because of the relative autonomy, but mainly because it exposed me as a professional to tons of people within the company. I also find the weekly-release culture very rewarding.  
  
I got to know so many different personalities and when a squad works well together, the results are noticeable!
  
I see software development as a major interest and try to maintain a balance of work and personal projects.
