Hi! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm A Bachelor of Computer Science, and Full-Stack Cloud Developer.  
  
I love problem solving, and when I'm not swearing at my PC because my lambda function won't deploy, or furiously debugging code at 2am, I wake up every day loving what I do. As the founder of the React guild at Glasswall, I have a passion for Typescript, ES6 and React. I'd love to contribute to projects where I can learn and collaborate on these!  
  
In my current role, I'm working with both Azure and AWS to build cloud-agnostic, serverless solutions. Having fun innovating and building on existing products by moving them to the cloud. The tech stack for this work is Typescript, Python, C#/.NET, Docker/Kubernetes and React. 
  
My first foray into the world of React started when I observed the need for better automated testing of Glasswall's SaaS solution's (Rebuild for Email) frontend, it was written in Razor pages and custom JQuery -not the easiest to debug when an issue pops up, and not the best developer experience! After spending some time with the team, I quickly realised something like Typescript suited their coding style, and the rest is history! Now we're using React in a huge number of projects, across the board, and everything we write is covered with Automated tests, as well as Selenium style tests using Puppeteer.
  
Lately, I've been working in development 'squads' while following an Agile Framework similar to the Spotify Model.  
I enjoy working as part of these small, high-impact teams. Partly because of the relative autonomy, but mainly because it exposed me as a professional to tons of people within the company. I also find the weekly-release culture and Kanban flow very rewarding.  
  
I see software development as a hobby I made a career out of, I try my best to maintain a balance of work and personal projects.
