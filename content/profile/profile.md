A Bachelor of Computer Science, and full-stack Software Developer.  
  
In my current role, I'm leading the push to adopt React (as a means to prototype and experiment with
frontend technology other than jQuery).  
  
I found myself in charge of small, autonomous squads;
while following an Agile Framework similar to the Spotify Model.  
  
I see software development as a major interest and have always maintained a balance of work
and personal projects.  
  
One project I started with a friend recently, [jdmcserver](https://github.com/werzl/jdmcserver),
is a Minecraft server hosted in an AWS EC2 instance. As well as a
static [frontend](https://werzl.github.io/jdmcserver-frontend/#/jdmcserver-frontend/Server) which
communicates with an API hosted on AWS API Gateway. The API connects Lambda functions, which toggle the running status of the
EC2 instance, and expose the serverâ€™s details.
