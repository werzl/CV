Hi! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm a developer and team lead at a world-leading cyber security software company.

As a Dev Manager / Scrum Master, I bring a history of overseeing the delivery of Cloud Native software. With a strong focus on Agile methodologies (Scrum) and continuous improvement, I have real experience delivering features from conception/discovery through to release, with regular public release cycles. My leadership approach brings to the forefront collaboration, openness, and innovation - enabling my team to hit their goals, while having fun along the way.

As a .NET Cloud Developer, I have experience designing, developing, and maintaining applications using C# and the .NET tech stack. With a foundation in object-oriented programming I specialise in building scalable, high-performance solutions. My expertise includes ASP.NET, Web API, and Entity Framework, alongside proficiency in front-end technologies (including Blazor, and React), database management and container orchestration using Kubernetes. I am passionate about clean code practices, continuous learning, and leveraging agile methodologies to deliver efficient, reliable, and maintainable software.
