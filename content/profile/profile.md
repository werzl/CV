Hi! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm A Bachelor of Computer Science, and Full-Stack Cloud Developer.  
  
I love problem solving, and when I'm not swearing at my PC because my lambda function won't deploy, or furiously debugging code at 2am, I wake up every day loving what I do. As the founder of the React guild at Glasswall, I have a passion for Typescript, ES6 and React. I'd love to contribute to projects where I can learn and collaborate on these!  
  
In my current role, I'm working with both Azure and AWS to build cloud-agnostic, SaaS solutions. Having fun innovating and building on existing products by moving them to the cloud, as well as creating new ones. The tech stack for this work is Typescript, Python, C#/.NET, Docker/Kubernetes and React. 
  
My first foray into the world of React started when I observed the need for better automated testing of Glasswall's SaaS solution's (Rebuild for Email) frontend, it was written in Razor pages and custom JQuery -not the easiest to debug when an issue pops up, and not the best developer experience! After spending some time with the team, I quickly realised the Typescript/TSX syntax suited their coding style, and the rest is history! Now we're using React in a huge number of projects, across the board, and everything we write is covered with Automated tests, as well as Selenium style tests using Puppeteer.
  
As leader of the React Guild at Glasswall, I've pioneered frontend work, creating a Frontend Style Guide, and a create-react-app template with our company's branding.  
  
I see software development as a hobby that I made a career out of, I try my best to maintain a balance of work and personal projects.
