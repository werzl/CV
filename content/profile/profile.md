Hi! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm a developer and team lead at a world-leading cyber security software company.

As a Team Lead / Scrum Master, I bring a history of successfully overseeing the end-to-end delivery of Cloud Native software projects, by driving cross-functional teams to meet goals, and ensuring on-time, high-quality solutions. With a strong focus on agile methodologies, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement, I align business objectives with technology solutions to optimise processes and deliver measurable value. My leadership approach brings to the forefront collaboration, accountability, and innovation - empowering my team to thrive while maintaining client satisfaction and operational excellence.

As a .NET Cloud Native Developer, I have experience designing, developing, and maintaining robust applications using C# and the Microsoft .NET technology stack. With a strong foundation in object-oriented programming I specialize in building scalable, high-performance solutions. My expertise includes ASP.NET, Web API, and Entity Framework, alongside proficiency in front-end technologies (including Blazor, and React), database management and container orchestration using Kubernetes. I am passionate about clean code practices, continuous learning, and leveraging agile methodologies to deliver efficient, reliable, and maintainable solutions.
