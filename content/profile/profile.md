Hi! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm a developer and team lead at a world-leading cyber security software company.
  
I love problem solving and when I'm not swearing at my PC because my build pipelines are failing, or furiously debugging code at 2am, I wake up every day loving what I do.
  
In my current role I'm mainly working on cloud native applications. I'm having fun innovating and building on existing products by moving them to the cloud, as well as creating new ones. The tech stack for this work is C#/.NET, Docker/Kubernetes, TypeScript, Python and React.
  
Developer experience is important to me, I've invested a lot of time in docker compose, webpack, building documentation for our developers, and writing utility scripts with Python and NodeJS. Amongst various Slack and Teams bots, I've contributed to coding standards and NPM Libraries to make development easier for my team.
    
I see software development as a hobby that I made a career out of, I try my best to maintain a balance of work and personal projects.
